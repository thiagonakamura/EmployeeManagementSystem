# 💼 Employee Salary Management System

> 🚀 A hands-on Java project demonstrating OOP mastery through inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism — with a real-world twist on salary computation.

---

## 🧠 About the Project

This application simulates a simplified **employee management system** for a company. Users can dynamically add employees via the console, choosing between **Managers** and **Developers**, and calculate their final salaries based on specific business rules.

This project was developed to **practice object-oriented programming principles**, model real-world behavior, and demonstrate clean, scalable code design using Java.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ **OOP Principles** fully applied:
  - **Encapsulation** using private fields and controlled access via getters/setters
  - **Inheritance** from a common abstract base (`Employee`)
  - **Polymorphism** via overridden `calculateSalary()` methods
  - **Abstraction** using an abstract class as a contract for salary logic

- 📋 **Dynamic User Input** with `Scanner`  
- 🔢 **Formatted Salary Output** using `Locale.US`  
- 📦 **Layered Structure** separating domain logic from application logic
- 🧪 Easily extensible for new employee types or bonus rules

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Java 17+ (but works with Java 8+)
- Standard Java Libraries: `Scanner`, `Locale`, `ArrayList`
